- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GutoRiella
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an ex Clipper and Cobol developer, who has changed the area in the middle of 1990s. 
- Nowadays I'm turning to develop, currently studying Python.
- I intent to develop a software to help identification and cataloguing animal species, starting with Brazilian bats, but the target is to expand to other animal clades.
- The software will be free and open source.
